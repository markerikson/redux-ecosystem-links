- **Tango**  
  https://github.com/Graf009/tango  
  Toolkit for building redux/react applications.  Easy to understand objects instead of crazy functional composition. Bundle groups of middleware, enhancers, and reducers together as "plugins". Dead simple Component API - use ES6 classes, bring back sane behavior, bind component functions scope to class (like old react), never write mapDispatchToProps or mapStateToProps.
  
- **Kea**  
  https://github.com/mariusandra/kea-logic  
  kea-logic lets you create logic stores, and access their contents from React components as props.  Logic stores consist of 1) actions, 2) reducers, 3) selectors and 4) optionally sagas.  Logic stores augment your components, are stored in redux, and are connected via ES6 imports.

  The core of Redux is simple. But it comes with a big ecosystem, middleware, action creators, selectors and other things attached that slow down development - a single change in specs shouldn't require changes in 5+ locations to implement. redux-plus makes developers more productive by finding one place for all state-related code: the reducer.
  
- **Conventional Redux**  
  https://github.com/mjaneczek/conventional-redux  
  Make your redux more friendly by adding conventions and writing less code! Combine actions and reducers into a interactor class; Dispatch action in a interactorName:method format (eg. this.dispatch('counter:double')); Handle an action by defining methods in the interactor

  https://github.com/newtoncodes/react-redux-oop  
  OOP implementation of redux and react.  It uses plain react, redux and react-redux. No functionality is changed or added to these libraries. It's only a way to organize your app with a bunch of helpful classes. Also it solves the problem with multiple stores and binded action creators.

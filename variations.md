- **Redux Model Utilities**  
  https://github.com/jbellsey/redux-model-utils  
  A set of model-building utilities for Redux apps.  Atomic actions and reducers, easy connection to React components, direct read-only access to the model state, subscription change notifications.
  
- **Vada**  
  https://github.com/xogeny/vada  
  https://medium.com/@mtiller/encapsulating-application-logic-with-reactors-392635763e7  
  Code to support a viewless, action driven architecture
  
- **redux-apis**  
  https://github.com/Download/redux-apis  
  Create class-based APIs that hide the fact that Redux is being used.
  
- **react-redux-provide**  
  https://github.com/loggur/react-redux-provide  
  https://medium.com/@timbur/react-automatic-redux-providers-and-replicators-c4e35a39f1  
  Wrap components with a smart component and later assign providers (i.e., stores and action creators) to it.
  
- **redux-tree**  
  https://github.com/dashed/redux-tree  
  Organize your redux stores in a tree-like structure.  redux-trees are tree-like structured schemas where the leaves are either another redux-tree or a redux compatible reducer (not both).
  
- **modular-redux**  
  https://github.com/ariporad/modular-redux  
  Build completely modular applications with redux
  
- **redux-2way-binding**  
  https://github.com/roderickwang/redux-2way-binding  
  Build two way binding with Redux and Immutable.
  
- **redux-interactions**  
  https://github.com/convoyinc/redux-interactions  
  A streamlined approach to managing your Redux action creators and reducers.  These observations have landed us on a pattern where you group related action creators and reducers into a single file, which we call an interaction.
  
- **redux-simple**  
  https://github.com/barbuza/redux-simple  
  Batching react-redux alternative with reverse subscription order.  Exposes Provider and connect with api similar to react-redux
  
- **Gambit**  
  https://github.com/Ghirro/gambit  
  Gambit is a hyper-thin library designed to make building API driven apps with Redux/React easier. It is not a Redux replacement, it is a library built on top of Redux.
  
- **remerge**  
  https://github.com/siawyoung/remerge  
  The sole purpose of Remerge is to provide a consistent interface for defining and manipulating state. It's extremely easy and intuitive to use once you get the hang of it. While there is a slight learning curve, hopefully our examples will ease the learning process.  Although Remerge was built for use with Redux, it can also be used standalone.

- **two-way-rest**  
  https://github.com/l2silver/two-way-rest  
  A react-redux plugin that facilitates changes to the state and backend data sources.

- **Radical**  
  https://github.com/nathan-rice/radical  
  Radical is a client API framework, designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of React/Redux applications. Radical allows you to model your client API and state via the composition of Actions and Namespaces.

- **redux-nimble**  
  https://github.com/bodyflex/redux-nimble  
  A library that removes a lot of the boilerplate necessary to use redux.

- **redux-direct**  
  https://github.com/LiquidLabsGmbH/redux-direct  
  With redux-direct you can use your action creators directly inside the reducers instead of having to define string constants for each action.
  
- **Tango**  
  https://github.com/Graf009/tango  
  Toolkit for building redux/react applications.  Easy to understand objects instead of crazy functional composition. Bundle groups of middleware, enhancers, and reducers together as "plugins". Dead simple Component API - use ES6 classes, bring back sane behavior, bind component functions scope to class (like old react), never write mapDispatchToProps or mapStateToProps.
  
- **Kea**  
  https://github.com/mariusandra/kea-logic  
  kea-logic lets you create logic stores, and access their contents from React components as props.  Logic stores consist of 1) actions, 2) reducers, 3) selectors and 4) optionally sagas.  Logic stores augment your components, are stored in redux, and are connected via ES6 imports.
  
- **redux-signals**  
  https://github.com/cerebral/redux-signals  
  The Cerebral signals running on Redux
  
- **redux-flux**  
  https://github.com/umidbekkarimov/redux-flux  
  Bring back Flux features to Redux.  
  
- **redux-observe-store-path**  
  https://github.com/d6u/redux-observe-store-path  
  Efficient and descriptive Redux React binding.  Unlike connect in react-redux, redux-observe-store-path will update tree leaf component directly, rather than passing down props at each level. This way we can skip middle level components and directly update deeply nested components.
  
- **redux-conductor**  
  https://github.com/alexyuly/redux-conductor  
  Automatically conduct event traffic through Redux by reacting to actions
  
- **Redux Action Thunk**  
  https://github.com/ShMcK/redux-action-thunk  
  Move your actions & types into Redux middleware.  No more importing actions & types. Instead, register your actions on startup and call them by dispatching strings. Redux Action Thunk (RAT) allows you to write more modular Redux code.

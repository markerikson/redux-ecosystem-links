  Abstractions around Redux for state management in React
  
- **causality-redux**  
  https://github.com/AndrewBanks10/causality-redux  
  https://github.com/AndrewBanks10/react-causality-redux  
  An extension to Redux that facilitates a cause-and-effect programming paradigm, and significantly reduces redux and react-redux coding.
  
- **Redux-Auto**  
  https://github.com/codemeasandwich/redux-auto  
  Automatically generate Redux stories and actions from your folder and file structure, using Webpack's context.
  
- **libertad**  
  https://github.com/FullstackTypeScript/libertad  
  Provides a context-free alternative to the connect function and the Provider component from react-redux, based on a declarative dependency injection API for Redux application powered by decorators, and the power of TypeScript and InversifyJS.

- **redux-class**  
  https://github.com/Rewieer/redux-class  
  Bringing class-style reducer factory to your redux stack.
  
- **redux-domain** 
  https://github.com/aight8/redux-domain  
  Manage your redux store, reducers, sagas in domains
  
- **react-dedux**  
  https://github.com/tiagomapmarques/react-dedux  
  Redux abstraction for state management in React 
  
- **redux-state-connect**  
  https://github.com/NikolayBorisov/redux-state-connect  
  Help to connect to native React Component State
  
- **react-redux-models**  
  https://github.com/tz5514/react-redux-models  
  Reducer logic and a higher-order component for managing model classes
  
- **react-redux-action-provider**  
  https://github.com/dsdenes/react-redux-action-provider  
  Automatically maps your action creators to your Redux store, and provides them to the child components through this.context.actions.  This saves you writing mapDispatchToProps boilerplate in every component.
  
- **redux-looking-glass**  
  https://github.com/zachcoyle/redux-looking-glass  
  Redux requires too much boilerplate - let's use it as a primitive!  Builds lens-based reducers and action creators using Ramda.
  
- **redux-redactions**  
  https://github.com/selsamman/redux-redactions  
  Reactions simplifies actions and reducers: actions and reducers defined right next to each other, no need for action type strings, no need to worry about not mutating the state, no need to wire togethe a reducer hierarchy, and in fact you don't define reducers - you just define functions that return a state slice.
  
- **redux-modules**  
  https://github.com/wtgtybhertgeghgtwtg/redux-modules  
  A simplistic alternate approach to https://github.com/procore/redux-modules.
  
- **disprux**  
  https://github.com/xaviercobain88/disprux  
  Command/Event Proxy for Redux 
  
- **duxen**  
  https://github.com/applitopia/duxen  
  High performance data engine maintaining complex immutable state for reactive applications. Fully integrated with Immutable.js, Redux, and Meteor.  Define a schema for your entire app state, and Duxen compiles the schema to generate reducers and action creators and handles the state using Immutable.js.
  
- **redux-o-actions**  
  https://github.com/grundiss/redux-o-actions  
  Another library for dispatching class instances as actions
  
- **Reduxable**  
  https://github.com/underscopeio/reduxable  
  Reusable Redux without boilerplate, by defining "state classes" for reducers.

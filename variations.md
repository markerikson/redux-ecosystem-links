  https://github.com/siawyoung/remerge  
  The sole purpose of Remerge is to provide a consistent interface for defining and manipulating state. It's extremely easy and intuitive to use once you get the hang of it. While there is a slight learning curve, hopefully our examples will ease the learning process.  Although Remerge was built for use with Redux, it can also be used standalone.

- **two-way-rest**  
  https://github.com/l2silver/two-way-rest  
  A react-redux plugin that facilitates changes to the state and backend data sources.

- **Radical**

  Radical is a client API framework, designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of React/Redux applications. Radical allows you to model your client API and state via the composition of Actions and Namespaces.

- **redux-nimble**  
  https://github.com/bodyflex/redux-nimble  
  A library that removes a lot of the boilerplate necessary to use redux.

- **redux-direct**  
  https://github.com/LiquidLabsGmbH/redux-direct  
  With redux-direct you can use your action creators directly inside the reducers instead of having to define string constants for each action.
  
- **Tango**  
  https://github.com/Graf009/tango  
  Toolkit for building redux/react applications.  Easy to understand objects instead of crazy functional composition. Bundle groups of middleware, enhancers, and reducers together as "plugins". Dead simple Component API - use ES6 classes, bring back sane behavior, bind component functions scope to class (like old react), never write mapDispatchToProps or mapStateToProps.
  
- **Kea**  
  https://github.com/mariusandra/kea-logic  
  kea-logic lets you create logic stores, and access their contents from React components as props.  Logic stores consist of 1) actions, 2) reducers, 3) selectors and 4) optionally sagas.  Logic stores augment your components, are stored in redux, and are connected via ES6 imports.
  
- **redux-signals**  
  https://github.com/cerebral/redux-signals  
  The Cerebral signals running on Redux
  
- **redux-flux**

  Bring back Flux features to Redux.  
  
- **redux-observe-store-path**  
  https://github.com/d6u/redux-observe-store-path  
  Efficient and descriptive Redux React binding.  Unlike connect in react-redux, redux-observe-store-path will update tree leaf component directly, rather than passing down props at each level. This way we can skip middle level components and directly update deeply nested components.
  
- **redux-conductor**  
  https://github.com/alexyuly/redux-conductor  
  Automatically conduct event traffic through Redux by reacting to actions
  
- **Redux Action Thunk**

- **redux-realtime-cqrs**  
  https://github.com/latam-autos/redux-realtime-cqrs  
  Redux Realtime CQRS is a library that lets you convert a traditional request/response rest api into a Real-time api with CQRS
  
- **redux-action-class-middleware**  
  https://github.com/diosmosis/redux-action-class-middleware  
  Redux middleware that lets you define async/sync actions as ES6 classes.
  
- **redux-semantic-action-middleware**  
  https://github.com/diosmosis/redux-semantic-action-middleware

  https://github.com/musicglue/react-relax  
  A minimal way of providing redux state to react components that doesn't use context
  
- **redux-plus**  
  https://github.com/ashtonwar/redux-plus  
  The core of Redux is simple. But it comes with a big ecosystem, middleware, action creators, selectors and other things attached that slow down development - a single change in specs shouldn't require changes in 5+ locations to implement. redux-plus makes developers more productive by finding one place for all state-related code: the reducer.
  
- **Conventional Redux**  
  https://github.com/mjaneczek/conventional-redux  
  Make your redux more friendly by adding conventions and writing less code! Combine actions and reducers into a interactor class; Dispatch action in a interactorName:method format (eg. this.dispatch('counter:double')); Handle an action by defining methods in the interactor
  
- **react-redux-oop**  
  https://github.com/newtoncodes/react-redux-oop  
  OOP implementation of redux and react.  It uses plain react, redux and react-redux. No functionality is changed or added to these libraries. It's only a way to organize your app with a bunch of helpful classes. Also it solves the problem with multiple stores and binded action creators.

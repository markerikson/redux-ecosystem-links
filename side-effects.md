### Side Effects


- **redux-thunk**  
  https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk  
  The simplest possible side effects approach: dispatch functions instead of objects, which then get access to `dispatch` and `getState`.  (Variations on the concept listed on the [Middleware](middleware.md) page.)
  
- **redux-saga**  
  https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga  
  Generator-based side effects approach.  Create "sagas", which act like background threads or daemons that can listen for actions and dispatch objects describing side effects.
  
- **redux-loop**  
  https://github.com/raisemarketplace/redux-loop  
  Sequence your effects naturally and purely by returning them from your reducers.  Also returns descriptive objects, which are executed later.
  
- **redux-side-effects**  
  https://github.com/salsita/redux-side-effects  
  Redux toolset for keeping all the side effects inside your reducers while maintaining their purity, using generators.
  
- **redux-action-side-effects**  
  https://github.com/jonnyreeves/redux-action-side-effects  
  Trigger side effects after actions have been reduced.
  
- **redux-task**  
  https://github.com/sskyy/redux-task  
  A Side Effects enhancer for redux. The idea is simple: By given an asynchronous task(such as submitting data to server) a name, redux-task will create and handle the task state for you automatically. Then you can retrieve the state with the task name in your component easily. No need to create store state like isSubmitting or submitFailed and manully change them any more. 
  
- **redux-saga-rxjs**  
  https://github.com/salsita/redux-saga-rxjs  
  RxJS implementation of the Saga pattern for Redux.
  
- **redux-remotes**

- **redux-haiku**  
  https://github.com/xaviervia/redux-haiku  
  redux-haiku proposes is that any side-effect can be treated just like a DOM side-effectâ€“that is, it can be done as the result of a state change. The state change can be identified by running a diff between the new and the old states on the segment of the state that the side-effect cares about, in the meanwhile reusing established patterns such as selectors, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps, etc.
  
- **redux-elmish**  
  https://github.com/minedeljkovic/redux-elmish

Similar to Redux Loop, but the implementation is much simpler and shorter, and it enables you to program with reducers without having to worry about lifting effects.

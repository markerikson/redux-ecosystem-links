- **rereduce**  
  https://github.com/slorber/rereduce  
  Simple reducer library for Redux. It's like Reselect but for reducers.  By using aggressive memoization, reducers can depend on each others in an efficient way, without having to query Redux store.  It works fine with time-travel debugging and server-side rendering, because reducers remains totally stateless pure functions.  It permits to replace the imperative waitFor of original Flux implementation by a purely functional approach.

  https://github.com/pixellyte/redux-data-components  
  Redux Data Components are React-like components that exist entirely within the Redux store. The components support lifecycle methods so that data events within the store can trigger subsequent actions without running afoul of the "don't dispatch while reducing" rule.

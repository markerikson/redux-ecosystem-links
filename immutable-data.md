### Immutable Data


#### Immutable Data Structures (Specialized)

- **Immutable.js**  
  https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/  
  Fully-featured data structures library that uses advanced internal data storage to efficiently manage modified references.  Very widely used, but also rather complex.

- **Mori**  
  https://github.com/swannodette/mori  
  ClojureScript's persistent data structures and supporting API from the comfort of vanilla JavaScript  
  
- **immutable-record**  
  https://github.com/b-gran/immutable-record  
  Typed immutable Records inspired by ImmutableJS, with automatic validation


#### Immutable Data Structures (Object Freezing)
  
- **seamless-immutable**  
  https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable  
  Immutable data structures for JavaScript which are backwards-compatible with normal JS Arrays and Objects.  Uses freezing.
  
- **redux-tcomb**

- **immu**  
  https://github.com/scottcorgan/immu  
  A TINY, fail-fast, lazy, "naked", simple immutable Javascript objects library.
  
- **icedam**  
  https://github.com/winkler1/icedam  
  Ice Dam: a very lightweight library to freeze data. Data is frozen at the edge, where your Flux container sends it to views.
  
- **updeep**  
  https://github.com/substantial/updeep  
  Easily update nested frozen objects and arrays in a declarative and immutable manner.
  
- **icepick**  
  https://github.com/aearly/icepick  
  Utilities for treating frozen JavaScript objects as persistent immutable collections
  
- **crio**  
  https://github.com/planttheidea/crio  
  Immutable JS objects with a natural API.  Creates wrapper objects with replacements for mutating APIs that return new objects instead.
  
- **seamless-immutable-cursor**  
  https://github.com/MartinSnyder/seamless-immutable-cursor

#### Immutable Update Utilities

- **immutable-ops**  
  https://github.com/tommikaikkonen/immutable-ops  
A collection of functions to perform immutable operations on plain JavaScript objects and arrays.  Like updeep but with batched mutations and no freezing.  Like icepick, but with batched mutations and a curried API that puts the target object as the last argument. No freezing.

- **Redecorate**  
  https://github.com/Wildhoney/Redecorate  
  Simple module for reducing immutable nested properties in Redux applications.  
  
- **object-path-immutable**  
  https://github.com/mariocasciaro/object-path-immutable

- **immutable-path**  
  https://github.com/baptistemanson/immutable-path  
  Immutable path is a simple micro library providing js object selectors and modifiers.  Stick to immutability: modification always returns a new instance of the object.  Free optin and optout: no need to wrap all your plain objects in classes, no init.

- **update-in**  
  https://github.com/dustingetz/update-in/  
  Persistent functional object updates on vanilla js data structures (wraps react-addons-update)

- **Sprout**  
  https://github.com/herrstucki/sprout/  
  Sprout provides a set of functions to help you work with nested data without all the headaches. Sprout never mutates the original data but returns new versions. This way, plain JavaScript objects (and arrays) can be effectively treated as if they were immutable.
  
- **Scour**  
  https://github.com/rstacruz/scour  
  Traverse objects and arrays immutably.  Scour is a general-purpose library for dealing with JSON trees.  Use it to: manage your Redux datastore; provide a model layer to access data in your single-page app; navigate a large JSON tree easily; rejoice in having a lightweight alternative to Immutable.js.
  
- **Timm**  
  https://github.com/guigrpa/timm  
  Immutability helpers with fast reads and acceptable writes.  Timm's approach: use plain objects and arrays and provide simple mutation functions that will probably not handle all edge cases.
  
- **emerge**  
  https://github.com/Mitranim/emerge  
  Utilities for creating and merging immutable data trees. Friendly to functional programming. Only plain JS objects, no custom classes, no OOP, bring your own data. 
  
- **reduxr-reducer-helpers**  
  https://github.com/chrisdavies/reduxr-reducer-helpers  
  A utility to handle common array manipulation reducer functions.
  
- **immutability-helper**  
  https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper  
  "React Immutability Helpers" most likely are [going to be deprecated](https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper/issues/1). This library is a drop-in replacement for `react-addons-update` that in addition allows you to extend its functionality.

  https://github.com/varak69/statesis  
  A smart state constructor for redux states. Statesis does a deep compare/copy of 2 states and compiles a new state which keeps references to unchanged objects from the old state and mixes them with new objects which have altered in the new state.
  
- **monolite**  
  https://github.com/kube/monolite  
  A small immutable update library that preserves TypeScript typing and static inference when operating on plain JS objects

- **mutateless**  
  https://github.com/dennisgulich/mutateless  
  Keep your sanity while working with immutable data structures.  A small utility module which provides a bunch of functions for working with immutable data structures. Instead of polluting or changing the way you work with your objects, we designed the functions to work on regular objects, lists and nested data structures of any kind.
  
- **immuter**  
  https://github.com/zaaack/immuter  
  An immutable react/redux state update helper, easily handle nested state with the least code.

#### Alternate Data Management Concepts

- **reduxdb**  
  https://github.com/wizawu/reduxdb  
  Redux with MongoDB-like API.  Dispatches internal Redux actions in response to API calls like `db.someCollection.insert({id : 1, name "abc"})`.

- **Vry**  
  https://github.com/JaapRood/vry  
  Data modeling with Immutable.js designed for use with Redux-like architectures.  Defining models using Immutable.js, making it easier to define defaults, parsing, serialisation, merging, identifiying entities, etc. Models are stateless (anaemic), meaning the instances (Immutable.Maps) are passed to the Model's methods as the first argument and a new / updated version is returned. This makes them a great fit to implement Redux reducers.

- **Datascript**  
  https://github.com/tonsky/datascript  
  Immutable database and Datalog query engine for Clojure, ClojureScript and JS

- **jseg**

- **redux-graph**  
  https://github.com/cape-io/redux-graph  
  Really basic graph database with entity and triple storage with some helper functions to join it all together. The module loosely follows the Hexastore approach. Six indices are created for every triple, in order to access them as fast as it is possible.

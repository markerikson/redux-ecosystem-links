  https://github.com/tonyhb/redux-ui  
  Easy UI state management for react redux.  Think of redux-ui as block-level scoping for UI state.

- **redux-react-local** [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/threepointone/redux-react-local.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/threepointone/redux-react-local)  
  https://github.com/threepointone/redux-react-local  
  Creates component wrappers with per-instance local state stored in Redux, as well as locally scoped actions and reducers

  The goal of this library is to provide a convenient way to manage transient state in a redux application.  The idea is similar to that of redux-form, but it differs in that it does not focus on forms, but on staged state, that is, parts of the state the a user intends to change but has not committed yet. Staged state may appear in different forms.
  
- **Redux Cursor** [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Dashlane/redux-cursor.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/Dashlane/redux-cursor)  
  https://github.com/Dashlane/redux-cursor  
  Local private slices of a global store for component encapsulation in a Redux model.  Redux does not like the cursors in their general implementation, but the criticism is focused purely on the low-level ability to mutate the state at will. redux-cursor resolves that by relying on actions just as base Redux.

  https://github.com/tomchentw/redux-component  
  Manage a component's local state using a local redux store.  A isolated redux store is created for each React component instance.

  https://github.com/popc0rn/redux-mount  
  Mount data on a path and change state values on the fly. No need to create reducers, actions, or selectors to handle view-specific state yourself.
  
- **redux-component-state** [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/cef62/redux-component-state.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/cef62/redux-component-state)

  Wrap your app to use it as component inside other app
  
- **redux-state-props**  
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-state-props
  stateProps is as a Higher-order Component to insert state as props into Stateless React Components in a declarative way (see stateProps for more info).  This package extends stateProps to use redux as a store.
  
- **redux-ephemeral** [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ashaffer/redux-ephemeral.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/ashaffer/redux-ephemeral)  
  https://github.com/ashaffer/redux-ephemeral  
  Library for managing transient local state in redux. Uses a hash array mapped trie internally, so it is extremely performant by default, but you still deal only with plain JS objects, and your redux state atom is still serializable in the same way.
  
- **relux** [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/namelos/relux.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/namelos/relux)

  Redux middleware for organizing business logic and action side effects.
  
- **redux-saga-rxjs**  
  https://github.com/salsita/redux-saga-rxjs  
  RxJS implementation of the Saga pattern for Redux.
  
- **redux-epic**  
  https://github.com/BerkeleyTrue/redux-epic  
  Redux-Epic is a library built to do complex/async side-effects and server side rendering(SSR) data pre-fetching using RxJS.
  
- **react-redux-observable**

  React helpers for redux-observable
  
- **redux-observable-process-fetch**  
  https://github.com/istarkov/redux-observable-process-fetch

- **redux-stream**  
  https://github.com/mcoetzee/redux-stream  
  Use RxJS 5 to compose side effect streams.  When composing your module's side effects, you have access to all state streams, which allows you to react to an independent module's state changes and produce side effects from it.
  
- **redux-flourine**  
  https://github.com/philpl/redux-fluorine  
  Redux Fluorine is an enhancer to transform Observables truly into a first-class citizen in Redux. It enables you to directly dispatch observables containing actions, which is called an "agenda".
  
- **redux-most**  
  https://github.com/joshburgess/redux-most  
  Most.js based middleware for Redux.  Handle async actions with monadic streams & reactive programming.
  
- **redux-cycle-middleware**  
  https://github.com/lmatteis/redux-cycle-middleware  
  Handle redux async actions using Cycle.js. 
  
- **redux-cycles**  
  https://github.com/cyclejs-community/redux-cycles  
  Bring functional reactive programming to Redux using Cycle.js 
  
- **redux-rxjs**  
  https://github.com/hwep/redux-rxjs  
  RxJS based middleware for Redux. Compose and cancel async actions and handle promise more. 
  
- **redux-observable-utils**  
  https://github.com/sckoh/redux-observable-utils  
  Utilities to create redux-observable epics for fetching data
  
- **redux-observable-stream-lite**  
  https://github.com/pshev/redux-observable-stream-lite  
  An alternative to redux-observable that uses the stream-lite library instead of RxJS
  
- **redux-driver**

  Event-Driven Middleware for Redux with RxJS and Socket.IO
  
- **redux-rx-http**  
  https://github.com/radiosilence/redux-rx-http  
  Uses react-observable to provide a nice HTTP layer. 
  
- **redux-observable-crud**  
  https://github.com/AlexHenkel/redux-observable-crud  
  Provides a redux-observer CRUD functions generator, to have a nice DRY code on observer files. This will increase scalability and maintainability as there's only one file to maintain.
  
- **xstream-redux-observable**  
  https://github.com/adz5a/xstream-redux-observable  
  Provides a factory function to create redux middleware, inspired by redux-observable, but using xtream instead of RxJS
  
- **redux-observable-source**  
  https://github.com/OlympusatDevelopment/redux-observable-source  
  A Redux Middleware and data flow architecture for passing an Observable stream through an adapter to populate the branches on a state tree with data. How you get data to the observable is up to you, making it highly adaptable to your data sources, ie. websocket or ajax response as providers.
  
- **redux-promise-observable**  
  https://github.com/AyWa/redux-promise-observable  
  A plugin for redux-observable. It allows to return a promise after an action as been dispatch, and resolve/reject the promise depending of others action. It can be use for redux-form 
  
- **redux-fetch-epic-builder**  
  https://github.com/pcmnac/redux-fetch-epic-builder  
  An utility lib to build "fetch actions" and generic EPICs handled by redux-observable.

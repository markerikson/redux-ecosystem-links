  RxJS implementation of the Saga pattern for Redux.
  
- **redux-epic**  
  https://github.com/BerkeleyTrue/redux-epic

  https://github.com/joshburgess/redux-most  
  Most.js based middleware for Redux.  Handle async actions with monadic streams & reactive programming.
  
- **redux-cycles**  
  https://github.com/cyclejs-community/redux-cycles  
  Bring functional reactive programming to Redux using Cycle.js

  https://github.com/sckoh/redux-observable-utils  
  Utilities to create redux-observable epics for fetching data
  
- **redux-observable-stream-lite**  
  https://github.com/pshev/redux-observable-stream-lite  
  An alternative to redux-observable that uses the stream-lite library instead of RxJS

- **redux-observable-crud**  
  https://github.com/AlexHenkel/redux-observable-crud

- **xstream-redux-observable**  
  https://github.com/adz5a/xstream-redux-observable  
  Provides a factory function to create redux middleware, inspired by redux-observable, but using xtream instead of RxJS
  
- **redux-observable-source**  
  https://github.com/OlympusatDevelopment/redux-observable-source  
  A Redux Middleware and data flow architecture for passing an Observable stream through an adapter to populate the branches on a state tree with data. How you get data to the observable is up to you, making it highly adaptable to your data sources, ie. websocket or ajax response as providers.
  
- **redux-promise-observable**  
  https://github.com/AyWa/redux-promise-observable  
  A plugin for redux-observable. It allows to return a promise after an action as been dispatch, and resolve/reject the promise depending of others action. It can be use for redux-form

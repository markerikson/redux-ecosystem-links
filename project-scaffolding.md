### Project Scaffolding and CLIs

- **redux-generators**  
  https://github.com/bpxl-labs/redux-generators
  Redux Generators is a lightweight, opinionated CLI that helps scaffold a scalable approach to Redux.

- **redux-thunk-scaffolding**  
  https://github.com/jmakeig/redux-thunk-scaffolding  
  Generate scaffolding for asynchronous Redux actions, in the style of redux-thunk middleware.
  
- **generator-redux**  
  https://github.com/banderson/generator-redux  
  CLI for Redux: next-gen functional Flux/React with devtools.
  
- **generator-redux-app**  
  https://github.com/chentsulin/generator-redux-app  
  Scaffold out a redux app
  
- **redux-cli**  
  https://github.com/SpencerCDixon/redux-cli  
  An opinionated CLI for building redux/react apps quicker
  
- **redux-boot**  
  https://github.com/choko-org/redux-boot  
  Modular Redux bootstrap with asynchronous side-effects.  Minimal Framework using Redux to develop modularized universal (backend and frontend) applications, based on functional programming paradigms and friends such as Map and Reduce, Immutability and Reactive programming.
  
- **redux-bootstrap**  
  https://github.com/FullstackTypeScript/redux-bootstrap    
  A `bootstrap()` function for initializing Redux applications. This module works by exporting a `bootstrap` function you can call in your project. It does not generate files for you – it is not a project template or project scaffolding tool. This library handles most of the common application initialization/bootstrapping that takes place every time you create a new Redux project.
  
- **mikey**  
  https://github.com/Mikeysax/mikey  
  Mikey is a node command-line tool for generating React-Redux projects, React-Redux containers, React components, React actions, React reducers, and React helpers.
  
- **Kea**  
  https://github.com/mariusandra/kea  
  kea provides: a scaffolding tool with multiple generators; a modular code structure that's optimized for clarity; a guide to teach you how it all fits together
  
- **react-redux-workbench**  
  https://github.com/calvinfroedge/react-redux-workbench  
  A starting point for creating React components, including babel, webpack, mocha tests, redux, hot reloads, etc.

- **Lore**  
  https://github.com/lore/lore  
  Respectully opinionated convention-driven framework for building React applications. Built on React, Webpack, Redux, and React-Router.

- **EOS-Redux**  
  https://github.com/amattson21/eos-redux  
  Redux CLI and Framework.  Can generate a starting project file tree, as well as individual action creators and reducers.
  
- **Racket**  
  https://github.com/mohebifar/racket  
  Racket is a yeoman generator for creating universal/isomorphic web applications, using React and Redux.
  
- **create-redux-app**  
  https://github.com/delvallejonatan/generator-create-redux-app  
  Add Redux, styled-components, and CLI generation of components and containers on top of create-react-app 
  
 - **redux-boilerplate-helpers**  
   https://github.com/alxlu/redux-boilerplate-helpers  
   A commandline tool and small helper library that helps you cut down on the amount of typing you need to do while writing Redux boilerplate.  redux-boilerplate-helpers's tool parses your code into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to automate adding Redux boilerplate code into your existing files. If you already have existing* action creators, constants, or a reducer in a file, it will ensure the code you want to add is put in the correct place. And if you are missing any of the files, the tool will create new ones for you.
   
 - **hmr-redux-mapper**  
   https://github.com/paulbrom/hmr-redux-mapper  
   A build tool whose purpose is to eliminate the need to manually specify the Redux components which are needed for hot swapping upon route change. The tool is designed to recursively walk each component in your project, starting at each route container, looking for all the Redux modules that are imported either directly by the route container or by any of its child components. That information is written in a mapping file (reducerMap.js).  You can then use the reduxMapperLoader integration module to automatically hot-swap all the Redux modules needed for a new route without the need to write any boilerplate code in your routing handlers to manually load the necessary modules.
   
- **redux-context**  
  https://github.com/zhengcan/redux-context  
  A redux delegate object used to create store, render page, and integrate React-Router and more.  Has functions that encapsulate setting up a Redux store, React-Router, and the Redux DevTools, and rendering them.
  
- **redux-tool**  
  https://github.com/danielstern/redux-tool  
  Redux-Tool, an unopinionated helper to create your Redux files for you, handling all the boilerplate. Redux apps are great, but often creating just one new user interaction requires touching 8, 9, even 10 or more files. This tool lets you automate that process easily.

### Side Effects - Generators


- **redux-saga**  
  https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga  
  Generator-based side effects approach.  Create "sagas", which act like background threads or daemons that can listen for actions and dispatch objects describing side effects.
  
- **redux-ship**  
  https://github.com/clarus/redux-ship  
  Redux Ship is a Redux middleware for side effects which focuses on: composition: you can duplicate and reuse sub-stores, as you would do with React components; typing: you can type check your code with 100% coverage in Flow; testing: you can run unit tests of your side effects, by taking snapshots of their execution traces.
  
- **redux-side-effects**  
  https://github.com/salsita/redux-side-effects  
  Redux toolset for keeping all the side effects inside your reducers while maintaining their purity, using generators.
  
- **redux-yield-effect**  
  https://github.com/wzrdzl/redux-yield-effect  
  Declarative side effects for redux with generators
  
- **Redux Rungen**  
  https://github.com/youknowriad/redux-rungen  
  Generator middleware for Redux (Based on rungen).  Similar to redux-saga, but with some simplifications.  
  
- **redux-task**  
  https://github.com/sskyy/redux-task  
  A Side Effects enhancer for redux. The idea is simple: By given an asynchronous task(such as submitting data to server) a name, redux-task will create and handle the task state for you automatically. Then you can retrieve the state with the task name in your component easily. No need to create store state like isSubmitting or submitFailed and manully change them any more. 
  
- **redux-fork**  
  https://github.com/floxjs/fork  
  Non blocking async call effects.
  
- **reelm**  
  https://github.com/tihonove/reelm

- **redux-typed-saga**  
  https://github.com/goshakkk/redux-typed-saga  
  Redux-typed-saga is an alternative, well-typed take on the awesome redux-saga. The inspiration for typing side effects came from Redux Ship. However, Redux Ship has a totally different paradigm.  This experimental project aims to rethink redux-saga with types as first-class citizens.
